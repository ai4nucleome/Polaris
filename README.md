# A Universal Tool for Chromatin Loop Annotation in Bulk and Single-cell Hi-C Data
**Polaris** is an advanced computational command line tool tailored for rapid and accurate detection of chromatin loops across a wide range of high-resolution 3D genomic contact maps. It is compatible with data from various experimental protocols, including bulk Hi-C, single-cell Hi-C, Micro-C, DNA SPRITE ......

- Using examples for single cell Hi-C and bulk cell Hi-C loop annotations are under **example folder**.
- The scripts and data to **reproduce our analysis** can be found at: .

> <b>NOTE:</b> We suggest users run Polaris on <b>GPU</b>. 
> You can run Polaris on CPU for loop annotations, but it is much slower than on GPU. 

> <b>NOTE:</b> If you encounter a `CUDA OUT OF MEMORY` error, please: 
> - Check the status of your GPU.
> - Try decreasing the `--batchsize` parameter. 

## Documentation

## Installation
Polaris is developed and tested on Linux machines with python3.9 and relies on several libraries including pytorch, scipy, etc. 
We **strongly recommend** that you install Polaris in a virtual environment.

We suggest users using [conda](https://anaconda.org/) to create a virtual environment for it (It should also work without using conda, i.e. with pip). You can run the command snippets below to install Polaris:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlanchetteLab/Polaris.git
cd Polaris
conda create -n polaris python=3.9
conda activate polaris
```
Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) as described on their website. It might be the following command depending on your cuda version:

```bash
pip install torch==2.2.2 torchvision==0.17.2 torchaudio==2.2.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```
Install Polaris:
```bash
pip install --use-pep517 --editable .
```
If fail, please try `python setup build` and `python setup install` first.

The installation requires network access to download libraries. Usually, the installation will finish within 5 minutes. The installation time is longer if network access is slow and/or unstable.

## Quick Start for Loop Annotation
```bash
polaris loop pred -i [input mcool file] -o [output path of annotated loops]
```
It outputs predicted loops from the input contact map at 5kb resolution.
### output format
It contains tab separated fields as follows:
```
Chr1    Start1    End1    Chr2    Start2    End2    Score
```
|     Field     |                                  Detail                                 |
|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|   Chr1/Chr2   | chromosome names                                                        |
| Start1/Start2 | start genomic coordinates                                               |
|   End1/End2   | end genomic coordinates (i.e. End1=Start1+resol)                        |
|     Score     | Polaris's loop score [0~1]                                              |
